# 🚀 Business Informatics Projects Portfolio

I am **Adam Trepáč**, a Business Informatics student at Masaryk University focused on the intersection of data, technology, and core business processes. This repository serves as a portfolio of Python projects and algorithms, demonstrating foundational coding skills, logical problem-solving, and a specialization in enterprise software concepts.

**Key Focus:** Logical modeling, Data Structure implementation, and **Process Thinking**—skills crucial for developing and implementing solutions in an ERP environment.

## 🛠️ Project Highlights & Technical Competencies

### 1. Algorithms and Data Structures (`/algorithms`)

| Project | Concept Demonstrated | Relevance to Business |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Pointers, recursion, efficient data searching (O(h) complexity), and data validation. | **Data Organization & Validation:** Foundational structure for managing hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts, master data). |
| **Graph Algorithms (BFS/DFS)** | Breadth-First Search (Queue), Depth-First Search (Stack/Recursion), and graph traversal. | **Process Optimization & Routing:** Core logic for finding the shortest path (e.g., supply chain logistics) or network flow analysis. |

### 2. Applied Logic and Problem-Solving (`/games`)

| Project | Concept Demonstrated | Relevance to Business |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Falling Tic-Tac-Toe** | 2D array manipulation (matrices), complex rule implementation (win condition logic), and managing interactive game states. | **Logical Modeling:** Ability to model complex business processes and conditional outcomes using structured data (matrices). |
